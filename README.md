# Connect Four
this is our 2me3 project

This is a connect four game built with swing with an AI. 
The entire code is well documented. You are free to use this code and distribute it however you like

To try out the game, simply download the 'ConnectFourGameFinal.jar' raw. Have fun! :)


Custom Game:
This feature allows you to setup a hypothetical connect four grid and start off your game from that instead of an empty board.

To use this feature, simply follow these steps:
- Download the 'data' folder in the same directory as the game and then run the game (or just create a folder named data and then download the 'savedGame.txt' file inside the data folder)
- Go to Custom Game and create your starting board (NOTE: To switch disc colors, simply click on that disc)
- After you're done, make sure the game is not in a winning state or an impossible state (e.g. floating discs). If it is, the game cannot be saved
- Finally, click the Save State button and a message should confirm if the operation succeeded
- To load the game from that state, click the Load Save State button from the Main Menu and it should start a PvP game from the state that you created
